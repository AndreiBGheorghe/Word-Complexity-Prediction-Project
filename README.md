# Word Complexity Prediction Project (teamwork)

A Machine Learning algorithm used to predict lexical complexity for Romanian words, focusing on a hybrid methodology that combines handcrafted linguistic features with contextual embeddings from RoBERT. Me and my teammate submitted this as an entry for a Kaggle NLP competition, in which we placed 18th.

This repository represents our submission for the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/t/488080b161694d58a0c66d5c07eeffa6.

More info can be found in the documentation.
